Old ways:
  Upstart
    Used as the default init replacement on Ubuntu, Upstart is very good at starting things up. 

  Supervisord 
    convenient to set up, and seems to get a fair amount of use in Pythonland. 
    Its main advantage over Upstart, Runit, and systemd is that Supervisord can easily start pools of several instances of a program. 
    This is useful if you want a pool of worker processes, e.g. as FastCGI workers.
