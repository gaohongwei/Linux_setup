Supervisord 
convenient to set up, and seems to get a fair amount of use in Pythonland. 
Its main advantage over Upstart, Runit, and systemd is that Supervisord can easily start pools of several instances of a program. 
This is useful if you want a pool of worker processes, e.g. as FastCGI workers.
