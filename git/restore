Everything you can do with a file, you can do with a folder too.


Files are deleted from working tree but not committed yet:

If you have not yet indexed (git add) your changes you can revert content of a directory:

git checkout -- path/to/folder
If the deletion is already indexed, you should reset that first:

git reset -- path/to/folder
git checkout -- path/to/folder
Restore the full working tree (not a single folder), but lose all uncommitted changes

git reset --hard HEAD
When files are deleted in some commit in the past:

Find the last commit that affected the given path. As the file isn't in the HEAD commit, this commit must have deleted it.

git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file_path>
Then checkout the version at the commit before, using the caret (^) symbol:

git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <file_path>
Restore the full working tree from a distant commit

git reset --hard <revision>
